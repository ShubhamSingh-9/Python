# Python

## Function
Any simple input to the function means some output.

## Data Type:
A program can handle different types of data depending on the programming language and the data structures used. Some common data types are integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, lists, dictionaries, and objects. Each data type has its properties and operations that can be performed on it. A program can handle multiple data types by using variables, constants, expressions, statements, functions, and classes.

### 1. Integers are numbers that can be positive or negative, such as 1, -2, 3, -4, and so on. They do not have any fractional or decimal parts. Integers can be used to represent discrete quantities, such as the number of students in a class, the number of apples in a basket, or the score of a game. The maximum value that an integer can handle is 10^308, which is a very large number. Beyond this limit, the integer may overflow or cause an error.

### 2. Decimal or Float data type is used to store numerical values that have fractional parts. For example, 3.14, 0.5, and -2.7 are all decimal or float values. The decimal or float data type can handle very large or very small numbers, up to 10^308 in magnitude. This means that the number can have up to 308 digits before the decimal point, or after the decimal point if it is negative.
