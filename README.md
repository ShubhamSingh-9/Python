# Python

## Function 
It's a mathematical concept that relates an input to an output. For any simple input to the function, there is a corresponding output that follows a certain rule or pattern. For example, the function f(x) = 2x takes any number x as an input and returns twice that number as an output.

## Data Type:
A program can handle different types of data depending on the programming language and the data structures used. Some common data types are integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, lists, dictionaries, and objects. Each data type has its properties and operations that can be performed on it. A program can handle multiple data types by using variables, constants, expressions, statements, functions, and classes.

### 1. Integers 
These are numbers that can be positive or negative, such as 1, -2, 3, -4, and so on. They do not have any fractional or decimal parts. Integers can be used to represent discrete quantities, such as the number of students in a class, the number of apples in a basket, or the score of a game. The maximum value that an integer can handle is 10^308, which is a very large number. Beyond this limit, the integer may overflow or cause an error.

### 2. Decimal or Float 
Data type is used to store numerical values that have fractional parts. For example, 3.14, 0.5, and -2.7 are all decimal or float values. The decimal or float data type can handle very large or very small numbers, up to 10^308 in magnitude. This means that the number can have up to 308 digits before the decimal point, or after the decimal point if it is negative.
